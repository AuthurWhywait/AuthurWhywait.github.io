## What is Multimodal?

**Modality**: The way in which something happens or is experienced.

- **Modality** refers to a certain type of information and/or the representation format in which information is stored.
- **Sensory modality**: one of the primary forms of sensation, as vision or touch; channel of communication.

**Medium**: A means or instrumentality for storing or communicating information; system of communication/transmission.

- **Medium** is the means whereby this information is delivered to the senses of the interpreter.

## Prior Research on "Multimodal"

Four eras of multimodal research:

1. The "behavior" era
2. The "computational" era
3. The "interaction" era
4. The "deep learning" era

## Core Technical Challenges

1) **Representation**: Learning how to represent and summarize multimodal data in a way that exploits the complementarity and redundancy.

2) **Alignment**: Identify the direct relations between (sub)elements from two or more different modalities.

3) **Translation**: Process of changing data from one modality to another, where the translation relationship can often be open-ended or subjective.

4) **Fusion**: To join information from two or more modalities to perform a prediction task.

1) **Co-Learning**: Transfer knowledge between modalities, including their representations and predictive models.
