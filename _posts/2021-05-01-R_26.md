[Non-linear least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_least_squares): Determine the nonlinear (weighted) least-squares estimates of the parameters of a nonlinear model.

```R
nls(formula, data, start)
```

- `formula`: a nonlinear model formula including variables and parameters. Will be coerced to a formula if necessary.
- `data`: an optional data frame in which to evaluate the variables in formula and weights. Can also be a list or an environment, but not a matrix.
- `start`: a named list or named numeric vector of starting estimates. When start is missing (and formula is not a self-starting model, see selfStart), a very cheap guess for start is tried (if `algorithm != "plinear"`).

example: In the example, we'll see what **the confidence intervals** for these assumptions are so that we can judge how good these values are in the model.

At first, we assume that the formula is like:

```R
a = b1*x^2 + b2
```

```R
xvalues <- c(1.6,2.1,2,2.23,3.71,3.25,3.4,3.86,1.19,2.21)
yvalues <- c(5.19,7.43,6.94,8.11,18.75,14.88,16.06,19.12,3.21,7.58)

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "nls.png")

# Plot these values.
plot(xvalues,yvalues)

# Take the assumed values and fit into the model.
model <- nls(yvalues ~ b1*xvalues^2+b2,start = list(b1 = 1,b2 = 3))

# Plot the chart with new data by fitting it to a prediction from 100 data points.
new.data <- data.frame(xvalues = seq(min(xvalues),max(xvalues),len = 100))
lines(new.data$xvalues,predict(model,newdata = new.data))

# Save the file.
dev.off()

# Get the sum of the squared residuals.
print(sum(resid(model)^2))

# Get the confidence intervals on the chosen values of the coefficients.
print(confint(model))
```

result:

```console
