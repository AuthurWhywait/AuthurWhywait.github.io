[Chi-square test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) is a statistical method to determine whether there is significant correlation between two categorical variables.

function:

```R
chisq.test(x, y = NULL, correct = TRUE,
           p = rep(1/length(x), length(x)), rescale.p = FALSE,
           simulate.p.value = FALSE, B = 2000)
```

- `x`: a numeric vector or matrix. x and y can also both be factors.
- `y`: a numeric vector; ignored if x is a matrix. If x is a factor, y should be a factor of the same length.
- `correct`: a logical indicating whether to apply continuity correction when computing the test statistic for 2 by 2 tables: one half is subtracted from all \|O - E\| differences; however, the correction will not be bigger than the differences themselves. No correction is done if simulate.p.value = TRUE.
- `p`: a vector of probabilities of the same length of x. An error is given if any entry of p is negative.
- `rescale.p`: a logical scalar; if TRUE then p is rescaled (if necessary) to sum to 1. If rescale.p is FALSE, and p does not sum to 1, an error is given.
- `simulate.p.value`: a logical indicating whether to compute p-values by Monte Carlo simulation.
- `B`: an integer specifying the number of replicates used in the Monte Carlo test.

```R
# Load the library.
library("MASS")

# Create a data frame from the main data set.
# car.data <- data.frame(Cars93$AirBags, Cars93$Type)

# Create a table with the needed variables.
car.data = table(Cars93$AirBags, Cars93$Type) 
print(car.data)

# Perform the Chi-Square test.
print(chisq.test(car.data))
```

`table()` uses the cross-classifying factors to build a contingency table of the counts at each combination of factor levels.
