## Normal Distribution

There are four built-in functions to produce a normal distribution in R.

```R
dnorm(x, mean, sd)
pnorm(x, mean, sd)
qnorm(p, mean, sd)
rnorm(n, mean, sd)
```

- `x`: a vector of numbers
- `p`: a vector of properties
- `n`: the number of observation(the size of samples)
- `mean`: the average of sample data, and its default value is zero
- `sd`: standard deviation, and its default value is 1.

`dorm()`: The function gives the height of the probability distribution of the given mean and standard deviation at each point.

```R
# Create a sequence of numbers between -10 and 10 incrementing by 0.1.
x <- seq(-10, 10, by = .1)
# Choose the mean as 2.5 and standard deviation as 0.5.
y <- dnorm(x, mean = 2.5, sd = 0.5)
# draw the chart
png(file = "dnorm.png")
plot(x,y)
dev.off()
```

`pnorm()`: This function gives the probability of normal distribution random number less than the given number. It is also known as the cumulative **distribution function**.

```R
# Create a sequence of numbers between -10 and 10 incrementing by 0.2.
x <- seq(-10,10,by = .2)
# Choose the mean as 2.5 and standard deviation as 2. 
y <- pnorm(x, mean = 2.5, sd = 2)
```

`qnorm()`: The function uses the probability value and gives the number of the cumulative value matching the probability value.

```R
# Create a sequence of probability values incrementing by 0.02.
x <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.02)
# Choose the mean as 2 and standard deviation as 3.
y <- qnorm(x, mean = 2, sd = 1)
```

`rnorm()`: This function is used to **generate random numbers with normal distribution**. It takes sample size as input and generates many random numbers. We draw a histogram to show the distribution of the generated numbers.

```R
# Create a sample of 50 numbers which are normally distributed.
y <- rnorm(50)
```

## Binary Distribution

There are four built-in functions to produce binary distribution in R.

```R
dbinom(x, size, prob)
pbinom(x, size, prob)
qbinom(p, size, prob)
rbinom(n, size, prob)
```

- `x`: a vector of numbers
- `p`: a vector of properties
- `n`: size of observation
- `size`: number of tests
- `prob`: probability of success for each test

`dbinom()`: gives the probability density distribution of each point.

```R
# Create a sample of 50 numbers which are incremented by 1.
x <- seq(0,50,by = 1)
# Create the binomial distribution.
y <- dbinom(x,50,0.5)
```

`pbinom()`: This function gives the cumulative probability of the event. It's a single value that represents probability.

```R
# Probability of getting 26 or less heads from a 51 tosses of a coin.
x <- pbinom(26,51,0.5)
```

`qbinom()`: uses the probability value and gives the number of the cumulative value matching the probability value.

```R
# How many heads will have a probability of 0.25 will come out when a coin is tossed 51 times.
x <- qbinom(0.25,51,1/2)
```

`rbinom()`: This function **generates the required number of random values** of a given probability from a given sample.

```R
# Find 8 random values from a sample of 150 with probability of 0.4.
x <- rbinom(8,150,.4)
```
