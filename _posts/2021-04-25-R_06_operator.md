## Types of the Operator in R

1. arithmetic operators
2. relational operators
3. logical operators
4. assignment operators
5. Other operators

## Arithmetic Operators(7)

* `+` addition
* `-` subtraction
* `*` multiplication
* `/` division
* `%%` mod
* `%/%` quotient
* `^` exponentiation

examples

```R
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v+t)
# 10.0  8.5  10.0

v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v-t)
# -6.0  2.5  2.0

v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v*t)
# 16.0 16.5 24.0

v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v/t)
# 0.250000 1.833333 1.500000

v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v%%t)
# [1] 2.0 2.5 2.0

v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v%/%t)
# [1] 0 1 1

v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v^t)
# [1]  256.000  166.375 1296.000
```

## Relational Operators(6)

* `>`
* `<`
* `==`
* `<=`
* `>=`
* `!=`

## Logical Operators(5)

All the number bigger than 1 will be considered as a logical value `TRUE`.

`&, |, !`: Each elements in the 1st vector will be compared to the corresponding elements in the 2rd vector.

`&&, ||`: Only consider the 1st elements in vectors. And the output is a vector that contain only one element.

## Assignment Operators

leftward assignment:

* `<-`
* `=`
* `<<-`

rightward assignment:

* `->`
* `->>`

## Other Operators

* `:` creates a series of numbers for vectors in order.
* `%in%` identifies whether the element belongs to a vector.
* `%*%` multiply a matrix by its transposition.

```R
v <- 2:8
print(v) 
# 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

v1 <- 8
v2 <- 12
t <- 1:10
print(v1 %in% t) 
print(v2 %in% t) 
# TRUE
# FALSE

M = matrix( c(2,6,5,1,10,4), nrow = 2,ncol = 3,byrow = TRUE)
t = M %*% t(M)
print(t)
#       [,1] [,2]
# [1,]   65   82
# [2,]   82  117
```
