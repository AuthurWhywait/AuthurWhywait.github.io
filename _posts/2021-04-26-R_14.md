A Matrix is an R object in which elements are laid out in a **two-dimensional** rectangular layout, they **contain elements of the same atomic type.**

We use a matrix containing numeric elements for mathematical calculations.

## How to Create

We use the function `matrix()` to create a matrix.

```R
matrix(data, nrow, ncol, byrow, dimnames)
```

* `data`: the inputs of the numeric elements in vector
* `nrow`: the number of rows to create
* `ncol`: the number of column to create
* `byrow`: if the value is `TRUE`, then the input elements will be arranged in rows.
* `dimnames`: the names assigned to the row and column

## How to Visit

use the index of row and column

## Calculate

When using R operators to perform various mathematical operations, the results of the operations should also be matrix.

Also, for the matrix involved in the operation, **the dimensions(number of rows and columns) should be the same**.

When using `*` and `/`, the elements of the two matrices with the same position will carry out the corresponding operation.

```R
# Create two 2x3 matrices.
matrix1 <- matrix(c(3, 9, -1, 4, 2, 6), nrow = 2)
print(matrix1)
matrix2 <- matrix(c(5, 2, 0, 9, 3, 4), nrow = 2)
print(matrix2)

# Multiply the matrices.
result <- matrix1 * matrix2
cat("Result of multiplication","
")
print(result)
```

        [,1] [,2] [,3]
    [1,]    3   -1    2
    [2,]    9    4    6
        [,1] [,2] [,3]
    [1,]    5    0    3
    [2,]    2    9    4
    Result of multiplication 
        [,1] [,2] [,3]
    [1,]   15    0    6
    [2,]   18   36   24
