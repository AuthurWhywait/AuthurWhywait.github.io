The package named "randomForest" is needed.

```R
install.packages("randomForest")
```

There is a function named `randomForest()` in package `randomForest` that can be used to create and analysis the random forest.

```R
randomForest(formula, data)
```

- formula: a data frame or a matrix of predictors, or a formula describing the model to be fitted (for the print method, an randomForest object).
- data: an optional data frame containing the variables in the model. By default the variables are taken from the environment which randomForest is called from.

```R
# Load the party package. It will automatically load other required packages.
library(party)
library(randomForest)

# Create the forest.
output.forest <- randomForest(nativeSpeaker ~ age + shoeSize + score, data = readingSkills)

# View the forest results.
print(output.forest) 

# Importance of each predictor.
print(importance(fit,type = 2)) 
```
