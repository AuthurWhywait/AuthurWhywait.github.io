## How to Load Packages

Before the packages can be used, we need to load them before the programme is running. (Also, packages downloaded before that cannot be used in the environment should be loaded at first as well.)

the command follows:

```R
library("package Name", lib.loc = "path to library")

# Load the package named "XML"
install.packages("E:/XML_3.98-1.3.zip", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## Update Packages

```R
update.packages("package name")
```

## Details of Packages

```R
help("package name")
```
