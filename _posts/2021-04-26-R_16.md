Factors are data objects used to classify data and store it as levels. It is useful in statistical modeling data analysis.

We can use `factor()` to create factor by using vector.

`is.factor()` can be used to see whether the R object is a factor.

When creating any data frame with text data columns, R language regards text columns as classified data and creates factors on them.

We can use `factor()` to use change the order of the level.

```R
new_order_data <- factor(factor_data,levels = c("East","West","North"))
```

We can use [`gl()`](https://www.w3cschool.cn/r/r_factors.html) to generate the factor level.

```R
gl(n, k, labels)
```
