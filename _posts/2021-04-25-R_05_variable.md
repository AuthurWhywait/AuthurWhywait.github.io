Variables in R can store atomic vectors, groups of atomic vectors or combinations of many `Robject`.

Valid names of variables consists of letters, numbers, dot or underscore characters.

## NAME RULES

Variable names begin with a letter or with a dot that doesn't follow a number.

| variable names | valid or invalid | reasons                             |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| var_name%      | invalid          | the character `%` is invalid        |
| 2var_name      | invalid          | begin with a number                 |
| .2var_name     | invalid          | begin with dot that follow a number |
| .var_name      | valid            | -                                   |
| _var_name      | invalid          | begin with a underscore characters  |

## Variable Assignment

THREE Methods:

```R
# Assignment using equal operator.
var.1 = c(0,1,2,3)           

# Assignment using leftward operator.
var.2 <- c("learn","R")   

# Assignment using rightward operator.   
c(TRUE,1) -> var.3
```

we print it, we can use `print()` or `cat()`. The examples follow:

```R
print(var.1)
cat ("var.1 is ", var.1 ,"
")
cat ("var.2 is ", var.2 ,"
")
cat ("var.3 is ", var.3 ,"
")

# results:
# [1] 0 1 2 3
# var.1 is  0 1 2 3 
# var.2 is  learn R 
# var.3 is  1 1 
```

> About function `cat()`: vector `c(TRUE,1)` is a mixture of logical and numerical variables. So the logical class will be cast to numerical class (TRUE -> 1).

## Data Types of Variables

> In the R language, a variable itself does not declare any data types, but instead gets the data type of the R-object assigned to it.

R is called **Dynamic Type Language**, which means that we can change the data type of a variable over and over again when we use the same variable in our programme. That's one thing different from C.

## Find Variables

use `ls()` function list the variables.

```r
# List all the variables we declared
print(ls())

# List the variables starting with the pattern "var".
print(ls(pattern = "var"))
# Hide variables that start with a dot
print(ls(all.name = TRUE))
```

## Delete Variables

use `rm()` to delete variables.

```R
# Delete variable named 'var.3'
rm(var.3)
# Using rm() and ls() to delete all the variables
rm(list = ls())
```

we should know that `rm(list = ls())` is totally different from:

```r
list = ls()
rm(list)
```

because the `rm()` function only remove the variable named 'list'.
