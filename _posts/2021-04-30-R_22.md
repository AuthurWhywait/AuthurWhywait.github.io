## Mean

Generic function for the (trimmed) arithmetic mean.

```R
mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
```

* `x`: the input vector
* `trim`: the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be trimmed from each end of x before the mean is computed. Values of trim outside that range are taken as the nearest endpoint.
* `na.rm`: a logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.

## Median

Compute the sample median.

```R
median(x, na.rm = FALSE)
```

* `x`: an object for which a method has been defined, or a numeric vector containing the values whose median is to be computed.
* `na.rm`: a logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.

## Mode

A mode is the most frequently occurring value in a set of data.

R language does not have standard built-in functions to compute mode. Therefore, we create a user function to calculate the schema of the dataset in R. This function takes a vector as input and a mode value as output.

```R
# Create the function.
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

# Create the vector with numbers.
v <- c(2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,5,5,3,2,3)

# Calculate the mode using the user function.
result <- getmode(v)
print(result)

# Create the vector with characters.
charv <- c("o","it","the","it","it")

# Calculate the mode using the user function.
result <- getmode(charv)
print(result)
```

result:

```result
[1] 2
[1] "it"
```
